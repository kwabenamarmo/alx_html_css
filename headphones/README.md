# Project: Implement a Web Page from Scratch

This project involves creating a fully functional web page from scratch, using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and your knowledge of **Accessibility** and **Responsive Design**. The goal is to replicate the design provided as closely as possible, without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

## Objective

- Build a fully functional web page that matches the provided designer file.
- Apply knowledge of HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design.
- Ensure the web page is accessible and optimized for various screen sizes.

## Requirements

- **HTML**: Use semantic HTML5 elements to ensure accessibility and proper structure.
- **CSS**: Write custom CSS to style the web page. Avoid using any libraries or frameworks like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.
- **Accessibility**: Make the web page accessible by following accessibility best practices (e.g., ARIA roles, alt attributes for images, proper heading structure).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the web page is responsive and works seamlessly on different devices and screen sizes.

## Features

1. **Semantic HTML Structure**: Use proper tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.
2. **Custom CSS**: Style the page to match the design using custom CSS.
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure the page adheres to accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1).
4. **Responsive Layout**: Use media queries to adapt the design for various devices.
5. **Pixel-perfect Design**: Strive for a layout that matches the design file exactly.

## Tools and Resources

- **Text Editor**: Use your preferred text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
- **Browser DevTools**: Use browser developer tools for testing and debugging.
- **Responsive Design Testing**: Test on multiple screen sizes and orientations.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the Design**:
   - Examine the provided designer file carefully.
   - Identify the structure, components, and style elements.

2. **Set Up Your Project**:
   - Create a project folder.
   - Create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file.

3. **Write the HTML**:
   - Build the structure of the page using semantic HTML elements.
   - Add meaningful content and placeholder text where necessary.

4. **Style the Page**:
   - Write custom CSS to style the elements.
   - Ensure the styles replicate the design.

5. **Implement Responsive Design**:
   - Use media queries to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.

6. **Test Accessibility**:
   - Use accessibility tools to ensure the page meets accessibility standards.

7. **Refine and Finalize**:
   - Make adjustments to ensure the page is pixel-perfect.
   - Test on multiple devices and browsers.

## Deliverables

- A functional `index.html` file.
- A `styles.css` file containing the custom CSS.
- A web page that closely matches the provided design.

## Tips

- Pay attention to details in the design, such as spacing, fonts, and colors.
